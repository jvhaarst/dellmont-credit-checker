To make things clear:

This is my copy/fork of the original, with some changes by me because I like to do some things different from the author.
I'll try to keep this in sync with the original as much as possible.


# dellmont-credit-checker 4.5.3 [09 Sep 2019] by Dominic

# Description
GNU/Linux program to notify if credit on one or more Dellmont/Finarea/Betamax voip provider accounts is running low. Once successfully tested it can be run as daily cron job with **-q** option and **-m email_address** option so that an email is generated when action to top up credit on the account is required. Can also run under MS Windows using Cygwin (<http://www.cygwin.com/>), or can be run as CGI job on Linux/Apache webserver.

# Usage
```dellmont-credit-checker.sh [option]```

# Conffile
A conffile should be in the same directory as **dellmont-credit-checker.sh** with name **dellmont-credit-checker.conf**, or if elsewhere or differently named then be specified by option **-f**, and should contain one or more lines giving the Dellmont/Finarea/Betamax account details in the form:

```website username password [test_credit_level_in_cents] [credit_reduction_in_cents] [credit_recordfile]```

where the **test_credit_level_in_cents** is >=100 or 0 (0 means 'never send email'). If you don't specify a **test_credit_level_in_cents** then the current credit level is always displayed (but no email is ever sent).

If you specify them, the **credit_reduction** and **credit_recordfile** work together to perform an additional test. The program will record in **credit_recordfile** the amount of credit for the given portal each time it is run, and notify you if the credit has reduced since the last time by more than the **credit_reduction**. This can be useful to warn you of unusual activity on the account or of a change in tariffs that is significant for you. Set the **credit_reduction_in_cents** to a level that is more than you would expect to see consumed between consecutive (e.g. daily) runs of **dellmont-credit-checker.sh** e.g. 2000 (for 20 euros/day or 20 dollars/day).

Here's an example single-line conffile to generate a warning email if the credit on the <www.voipdiscount.com> account falls below 3 euros (or dollars):

```www.voipdiscount.com myaccount mypassword 300```

# CGI_Usage
Here is an example of how you could use **dellmont-credit-checker.sh** on your own (presumably internal) website (with CGI configured appropriately on your webserver):

http://www.mywebsite.com/dellmont-credit-checker.sh?options=-vf%20/path/to/my_conf_file.conf%20-m%20me@mymailaddress.com

# Options

- -c [path] - save captcha images (if any) at path (default is current path)
- -d debug - be very verbose and retain temporary files
- -f [path/conffile] - path and name of conffile
- -h show this help and exit
- -l show changelog and exit
- -m [emailaddress] - send any messages about low credit or too-rapidly-falling credit to the specified address (assumes sendmail is available and working)
- -n delete any existing cookies and start over
- -p pause on cookie expiry - wait 2 minutes if cookies have expired before trying to login (because cookies are usually for 24 hours exactly this should allow a second login 24 hours later without requiring new cookies)
- -q quiet
- -s skip if captcha code is requested (e.g. for unattended process)
- -v be more verbose

# Dependencies
awk, bash, coreutils, curl, grep, openssl, sed, [sendmail]

# Portal List
Here is a list of websites / sip portals belonging to and/or operated by Dellmont. To find more, google "is a service from dellmont sarl" (with the quotes). Try a portal with **dellmont-credit-checker.sh** - it might work!

If one of these (or another which you know is run by Dellmont) does not work, run dellmont-credit-checker.sh with -d option and drop me an email attaching the temporary files (two or three per portal, password is stripped out anyway).
